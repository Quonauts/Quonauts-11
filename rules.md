## <a name='meta-rules'/> Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='glossary'/> Glossary

The definitions for terms listed here take precedence over their normal English meanings, however any terms defined in a specific section of the rules override these in the section in which they are defined and its subsections. A section may also define terms for use in the whole document.

* **The Game**: The instance of Nomic governed by these rules.
* **Game Channel**: Any text or voice channel listed under the "Game Channels" category of the Discord server.
* **Game Action**: Any modification of the game state.
* **Game State**: Every current rule; every non-deleted proposal and any votes on it; every poll and any votes on it; and every message or reaction in any game channel.
* **The Rules**: The rules of the game, which are described by this document.
* **Section**: A part of the rules contained under one header. Unless otherwise specified, this does not include its subsections.
* **Subsection**: A section contained within another another section.
* **Clause**: A single statement in the rules.
* **Player**: Any participant of the game.
* **Active Player**: Any player who has performed a game action in the preceding 72 hours, and is a member of the Discord server.
* **Inactive Player**: Any player who is not an active player.

### <a name='accuracy'/> Accurcay

This document is not guaranteed to always be up-to-date as the game rules are modified, however it is the duty of all players to keep this document accurate as game rules are modified. Where this document disagrees with the game rules, players must follow the game rules as they are, rather than their description in this document.

### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:

* If and only if precedence is specified in the relevant rules and is non-contradictory, follow the instructed precedence.
* The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

### <a name='forbidden-actions'/> Forbidden actions

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.

Any game action that is forbidden (a "rule violation") is considered void and does not modify the game state; the action and its consequences are to be reverted.

### <a name='timezones'/> Timezones

Unless otherwise specified, all times and dates are specified with respect to UTC.

### <a name='bots'/> Bots

Certain game functions may be performed automatically by automated "bots"; the behaviour of such bots is not governed by the rules, and any function that bots may perform should be feasible, even if inconvenient, to do manually.

Bots are not players.

### <a name='rule-content'/> Rule content

Rules must not refer to individual players, except by using a Discord mention.
